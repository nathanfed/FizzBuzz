Fizz Buzz test in Swift

Having just heard about the Fizz Buzz test on the ATP podcast I decided to try it myself as I'm in the process of learning Swift.
Swift is the first language I've tried to learn and I don't have a CS background. 
I could not write the FizzBuzz code off the top of my head but it did give me the opportunity to learn what % did.
